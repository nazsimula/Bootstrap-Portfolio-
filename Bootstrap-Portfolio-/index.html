                <img src="image/snowfall.png" alt="Snowfall Photo">In the cold of early winter, snow begins to fall—at
                first slowly, melting fast, and then in big flakes, swirling and twirling. Across the glistening meadow,
                in the magical moonlit night, a small bunny and his brothers and sisters explore the wonders of this
                newly snow-filled world. Bernette Ford’s lyrical text and Sebastien Braun’s stunning illustrations
                capture the joy and beauty of the season’s first snowfall.
                In the winter, cold winds blow down
                from Siberia, pick up moisture over the Japan Sea,
                and drop it as snow when they strike the moun-
                tains of Japan. The west coast of the main island
                of Japan is probably for its latitude (roughly,
                from Cape Hatteras to New York, or from Spanish
                Morocco to Barcelona) the snowiest region in the
                world. From December to April or May only the
                railroads are open, and the snow in the mountains is
                sometimes as much as fifteen feet deep. The expression “snow country,” then, does not
                mean simply country where snow falls. It means
                very specifically the part of the main island that
                lies west of the central mountain range. It suggests
                long, gray winters, tunnels under the snow, dark
                houses with rafters black from the smoke of winter In the winter, cold winds blow down
